Welcome to a Chrome dinosaur browser game! Your objective is to jump over as many cacti as you can without getting hit. If you get hit, then you lose!
My inspiration for this was that the original Chrome game really interested me because it was very interesting to think that there was an entire programmed game within a web browser that only presented itself if there was no internet connection. So, I decided to tackle it to really see just how complicated the game could be. This game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies with no libraries used. 

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS: -->
1. Click to jump
2. Don't get hit by the cacti
